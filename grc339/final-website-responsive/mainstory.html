                            <h2>Jeff Grosso: A skateboard love affair 1968–2020</h2>
                    
                                <p>The following is our memorial and celebration of beloved verticalist, commentator and friend of the mag Jeff Grosso. It first appeared in our July 2020 issue. The Brat, Mothra, Grossman or just plain Jeff, Grosso went from number-one amateur to '80s superstar to cautionary tale and back again. His latest role as lovable curmudgeon, host of his own history-packed web series and keeper of skateboarding's righteousness, unafraid to offend or annoy in his quest to educate, was by far his greatest—second only to being Oliver's dad. Ripping 'til the end, he became an unlikely mentor to the generations that followed—from Muska and Tom, to Lizzie and Brighton. Jeff could be as gentle and sincere as he could be hilarious and hard (on the coping and himself). He always skated with style. His grinds were long, his backside airs were head-high and his handplants were stalled out and sadder than a funeral. He will be sorely, sorely missed. Our hearts go out to his family and many friends. Please share your memories in the comments. RIP, Jeff Grosso. —Michael Burnett

                                <p>Jeff and I met in 1979 in fifth grade. After 40 years of skating together — from riding as unsponsored amateurs in the ASPO contests in 1981 to the Vans Pool Parties with the best skaters of the world today, there was one story that Jeff and I both laughed at every single time we heard it. One Friday afternoon when we were in sixth grade, Jimmy Grosso picked us up to go to Skate City in Whittier. These were the days when we were at the skatepark from open to close every Saturday and Sunday. Jeff and I were sitting in the backseat of the car talking about skating and the session. As we are leaving Jeff's house, we see a girl jogging towards us down the street. Jimmy yells back that we shouldn't be talking about skateboarding —we should be focusing on the hot chick running towards the car. The runner was a neighbor of Jeff's, was in sixth grade with us and was the hottest girl in school. She had huge boobs, was wearing dolphin shorts and looked like she belonged in college. As she got a little closer to the car, Jimmy slowed down to nearly a stop, looked the girl up and down and then yells out "Hey, baby, slow down. I smell hair burning." He started laughing like crazy and floored it down the street! Jeff and I looked at each other with horror in our eyes, thinking this girl's boyfriend was going to beat us up at school. Jimmy looked back and yelled, "Don't worry. Everything will be alright!" -Eric Nash

                                <p>I was at the 1985 Rage in the Badlands amateur finals held in the original Combi pool. Back then skaters would hand a cassette tape with their song cued up to the announcer before a heat. Everett Rosecrans announces, "Next up, Jeff Grosso," and pushes play. The opening riffs of Kiss' "Detroit Rock City" burst from the speakers. Moments later Jeff rockets into view and proceeds to manhandle the most intimidating pool in history, throwing powerful maneuvers at every power chord's crescendo then pumping his fist during a lengthy rock-and-roll slider, bringing the crowd to a frenzy. Some pyrotechnics at the end of his run would not have seemed out of place. He easily won the contest that day. That was my introduction to Jeff Grosso. I remember thinking, I like this kid because he went fast, and skating to Kiss was not the cool thing to do in '85 but he wasn't there to be hip. He was there to rock and roll! Eventually I'd work with him on his first pro shapes during his brief tenure at Schmitt Stix, then skate and rage with him and our gang for decades. But it wasn't until after he emerged from his dark times that our working friendship truly blossomed. You see, Jeff had a way of frustrating skateboard shapers, manufacturers, professors and the like. "He's too demanding," or "He can't be satisfied," they'd say. I, on the other hand, never found him frustrating. I not only understood what he wanted but also why he wanted it that way. He liked that we could work on his shape in my garage, free from the red tape of whoever his sponsor was at the time. I'm sure a few brand managers weren't pleased seeing him riding decks that obviously weren't theirs at key contests and photo shoots. But when it came to equipment, compromise was not an option for him. He loved skateboarding too much for that. Jeff truly appreciated every deck I made him, even the unsuccessful ones. "Chuck loved this board," he'd say. I'm proud to say our little skateboarding rants while we worked on decks were one of the sparks of inspiration for the Love Letters. But the man I'm truly going to miss is the one who I'd find picking lemons from our tree at random hours for his then-pregnant wife who had a craving for "Chuck lemons," the friend who let me produce several unpaid guest models for my small brand Deckcrafters because he knew my family needed the money, the chain-smoking comedian poet laureate who made my cheeks and sides hurt from laughing and most of all the joyous devoted father sharing his love of skateboarding and life with his son Oliver. -Chuck Hults

                                <p>The saying "Don't meet your heroes" can sometimes ring true, but that wasn't the case when I first encountered Jeff Grosso as a kid at the Turf skatepark. The dude was literally exuding colors I've never seen before. There he was, that dude in the videos who did the sickest backside airs and inverts. I couldn't believe it! I'm pretty sure I asked him about his setup and he kindly obliged me, laughed and rolled into the clover bowl. I met Jeff again in Huntington Beach in the mid-90s. One time he rolled up to the HB park and I was so hyped 'cause I'd just made 80 bucks slanging shit. Once he figured out I had gotten there first and raked in the cash he was bummed. It was a stark contrast in greetings. I felt bad and bought a used shirt off him. I wondered what the future held for one of my favorite skateboarders. Fast forward a couple decades and I'm sitting shotgun in his beloved German automobile driving home from a sesh on top of the world. I would laugh and think to myself, How do I even still know this mutant? I still couldn't believe it. His dark times were well behind him at this point. He was a survivor and he credited that to his obsession of riding a skateboard over all the other crap—plain and simple. If you think about it, his tattered 50-year-old torso doing inverts the same way he did as a kid defied logic and science, so it had to be some sort of magic spell. He had it and he contributed that magic to skateboarding up until his last second on the planet. Jeff was my hero. He always was, but even more so these past years watching him be a dad. Of course I never told him that. I kinda wish I did, but I'm glad I can tell his son Oliver that here and now. -Sam Hitz

                                <p>I started skating with Jeff a lot at Pipeline skatepark, then Phil's ramp in Arcadia, then the big vert ramp we built in Ontario by the airport. Don't forget we lived together during the Santa Cruz video days and his Speed Freaks clip, "Mom, check out my new style, my new fashion," is classic Grosso. We loved him like a little brother and I was tasked with "keeping an eye on him." Those days were so special. Looking back now, the video moments are just so awesome in today's world. In the 1990s he lived with Kelly Belmar and we rode the pool together a lot. We had the sickest sessions before they built the Vans Orange skatepark and the new Combi. Then we had all the years there and getting to travel together to ride the other Vans skateparks and Bondi in Australia, NYC Chelsea pier park and all the other places we visited. Jeff was instrumental in getting me there, hyping up the Vans office to believe in the old-guy crew, Jeff was like that—he wanted to include everybody. He wanted everyone to have fun, skate and have a good time. I'm still reeling from not being able to talk to Jeff on our late-night calls about all things. I'm gonna miss his smile and those ginger freckles. I'm gonna miss those crowd flip-offs with his fuck-you attitude and take-it-or-leave-it style. I keep picturing you flipping us all off to say bye. I'm gonna miss you, my friend. My prayers go out to the Grosso family. -Salba

                                <p>Jeff always made an impression; he was always funny. And I have such reverence for the Whittier crew in general and he was one of the main players there. So him, Lucero, Lance, Neil Blender, Hagop—those guys were all some of my favorite people and just always really fun and creative. I don't think people really knew how talented he was, especially when playing the hits, like doing handplants, Madonnas, footplants and stuff like that. He never lost a beat. Even when he was out of shape he was still killing those tricks. And I was reminded recently, he used to do McTwists! Then later, with announcing the Combi contests and with the Love Letters, he became the voice of constructive criticism/searing commentary. You tuned in 'cause he was like the Howard Stern of skate commentary. I don't even remember who won the event-1 just remember Jeff's commentary! -Tony Hawk
